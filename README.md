JStruct can be used in the following ways:
- **Development and Learning**: creating from scratch a new Java program, you use the GUI to add new structured elements, comments etc ...
- **Reverse engineering**: highlighting the structure of classes and methods will facilitate the understanding of the code. Also you can use colors, add comments and change the variable names.
- **Documentation**: exporting an image you have complete control over fonts, colors, details.
- **Tool add-on**: adding JStruct tool to an IDE (eg JCreator ) you add a graphical structured environment.
- **Pretty-printer**: a passage of a source java file in JStruct (imports + exports) produces a standard formatted output.
